## Dependencies

All the notebooks in the repository should work out-of-the-box on Google Colab. We also provide a `requirements.txt` which contains all the Python libraries needed to run the notebooks locally, meant to be used with Python 3.8.*. To install all of them with pip in a single command (linux/macos) run:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`
